Execute the Makefile to compile four programs.

The command to execute a program is:
    ./<program_name> -f <data_file_name> -p <number_of_threads>
    -i <number_of_iterations>

The elinimated matrix will be written into a new file with a similar name to the
name of the program. The print out is the average time in seconds to perform a
Gaussian Elimination per iteration.

To compare the result of two eliminated matrices written in two files use:
    ./cmpfile.o <file1_name> <file2_name>
which simply tell if two files have identical content.
